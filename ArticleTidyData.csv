"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/world/europe/meghan-markle-baby-boy.html","LONDON — The Duke and Duchess of Sussex — better known as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle — on Monday welcomed their first child, a boy, the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy’s recent history.The newborn is seventh in line to the British throne, behind Prince Harry. It is not clear whether the child will receive a royal title, like those bestowed on the three children of Prince William, Harry’s older brother, and William’s wife, Catherine.Buckingham Palace said in a statement that Meghan gave birth at 5:26 a.m. and that her mother, Doria Ragland, was with the new parents at their home, Frogmore Cottage. The newborn boy weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces, the royal couple wrote on Instagram; a name had not been chosen yet.“This little thing is absolutely to die for, so I’m just over the moon,” a beaming Prince Harry told reporters outside the couple’s residence near Windsor Castle. “Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It’s been the most amazing experience I can ever possibly imagine. How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension, and we’re both absolutely thrilled.”The baby is sure to be the object of uncommon fascination, adored and criticized as a symbol of the modernization of Britain’s royal family.Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, have shaken up the royal family in a number of ways: The duchess is an American and a former actress, and their wedding last May featured a gospel choir, a freestyling African-American bishop and a gaggle of Hollywood celebrities.They continued to set aside convention after the wedding, opening their own Instagram account and offering little access to the royal-obsessed British news media. In April, they announced they were canceling the traditional photo opportunity outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital in the heart of London, curtailing the ritual hullabaloo that usually surrounds royal births.For many, the new baby’s importance will be indelibly linked with race.Britain is 87 percent white, but multiracial children make up its fastest-growing ethnic category, and will soon be the country’s largest minority group. The entry of Meghan Markle, the descendant of plantation slaves, into the royal family resonated deeply with many people of African descent, who almost immediately began to anticipate the birth of the couple’s first child.“It’s hopeful for people of my kids’ generation to see a princess of mixed race,” said Lise Ragbir, who is black and has written of her own experience raising a lighter-skinned child.Repeatedly, beginning when her daughter was 6 months old, she said, strangers have approached her to ask, “Is that your baby?”“It will be such a recognizable baby that it could shift people’s awareness,” said Ms. Ragbir, 45, a gallery director in Austin, Tex. “When one of the most famous families in the world does not have the same skin tone, people might pause before asking a stranger, ‘Is that your baby?’”Historians have noted that the duchess herself cannot be definitively described as the first multiracial royal. Some scholars have argued that Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III, had African ancestry through the Portuguese royal family. If true, it would have been passed on to her own descendant, Queen Victoria.Prince Harry, in particular, has been alert for racism in the discussion of his young family.In 2016, he took the unusual step of condemning British tabloids and social media commentators for the “racial undertones” and sexism of their coverage of Ms. Markle. Last year, the right-wing U.K. Independence Party ousted its leader after it was reported that his girlfriend had used racist language to deride the future duchess.The duchess, the daughter of a white man and a black woman, grew up in a mostly white neighborhood, where her mother was sometimes mistaken for her nanny. In an essay, she described hesitating, as a schoolgirl, when she was asked to fill out a census form that identified her as either white or black.“There I was (my curly hair, my freckled face, my pale skin, my mixed race) looking down at these boxes, not wanting to mess up, but not knowing what to do,” she wrote in an essay for Elle Magazine published in 2015.When her teacher told her to check “Caucasian” because that was “how she looked,” she refused.“I left my identity blank — a question mark, an absolute incomplete — much like how I felt,” she wrote. Her father advised her, “If that happens again, you draw your own box.”As the duchess’s due date approached, some Britons voiced concerns about the conversation around the child’s race.“Colorism is definitely a huge thing, and I think that links into it, because if the child does come out darker skinned, then you know that’s going to make the news — and not for a good reason,” Tanya Compas, a youth worker, told the BBC’s “Woman’s Hour” program when the pregnancy was announced.Journalists have bridled at charges that their coverage of the royal family has been tainted by racism, pointing out that British news outlets have always been free to criticize the royals, whose luxurious lifestyle is supported by public funds.Among the sore points this year was the baby shower hosted by celebrity friends of the duchess in New York, a privately financed event that was said to cost 330,000 pounds, or more than $430,000.“The clash comes when a free-spending American TV celebrity, the independent Ms. Markle, becomes the British queen’s granddaughter-in-law and joins soberer ornaments on the cracked marble mantelpiece of ancient royalty,” the journalist Libby Purves wrote in February in a column for The Times of London.The Sussexes, in short, have become another front in the British culture wars, like the vegan sausage roll, or Brexit. The tabloids have pounced: Prince Harry is making a television series on mental health with (gasp) Oprah Winfrey! The duchess keeps hugging members of the public! They may choose an American nanny! Baby Sussex may not attend Eton!Last fall, the couple announced they would move out of Kensington Palace, in central London, and take up residence about 25 miles west of the British capital in newly refurbished quarters: Frogmore Cottage, near Windsor Castle. There have been rumors that the couple could be dispatched in the next few years on an extended tour of Africa, where 19 nations, mostly former colonies, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations.Those moves appeared to hint of a rift between Harry and his brother, William, observers said, but no concrete evidence has surfaced.The duchess hinted of her hopes for her child when speaking on a panel for International Women’s Day in March, saying she expects it to be a feminist.Citing a phrase she had seen in a documentary about “the embryonic kicking of feminism” during pregnancy, she said, “I loved that, so boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that that’s the case with our little bump.”[The topics new parents are talking about.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/sports/kentucky-derby-stewards-video-review.html","LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After a tense review period that lasted more than 20 minutes, after the apparent winning connections had already been interviewed on live television, the three stewards at Churchill Downs on Saturday made the difficult decision to disqualify Maximum Security for interfering with other horses around the final turn and gave the Kentucky Derby victory to the 65-1 shot Country House. In the 145-year history of the Derby, no other horse had lost a win for such an act.An objection is a claim of foul lodged by a rider, a patrol judge or another racing official. The stewards, who oversee races  for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and for Churchill Downs, got to work studying replays of the race, with millions of dollars riding on their decision. They analyzed every available angle of the race on screens in a tiny clubhouse office high above the racetrack.[Update: Maximum Security will skip Preakness; Owner to appeal disqualification.]This job has existed for ages in America’s oldest sport, essentially making stewards the pioneers of video review. Committed to protecting bettors, they stay out of sight and rarely speak to the news media, so it was an odd sight on Saturday when the  stewards — Barbara Borden, chief steward of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission; Brooks A. Becraft, a state steward; and Tyler Picklesimer, a track steward — were  on the podium usually reserved for the winners of America’s biggest horse race.Borden  read a statement explaining the decision. She declined to take any questions. (The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission is a state government agency charged with regulating the conduct of horse racing and parimutuel wagering on horse racing and related activities.)She explained that the riders of No. 18, Long Range Toddy, and No. 20, Country House, had lodged complaints against Maximum Security, saying there had been interference as they left the quarter-pole and headed for home. “We had a lengthy review of the race,” Borden said. “We interviewed affected riders.” She said the stewards had unanimously agreed that Maximum Security drifted out and affected the progress of No. 1, War of Will, in turn interfering with Long Range Toddy and No. 21, Bodexpress.“Those horses were all affected, we thought, by the interference,” she said. “Therefore, we unanimously determined to disqualify No. 7 and place him behind the 18, the 18 being the lowest-placed horse that he bothered, which is our typical procedure.” That made Maximum Security the 17th-place finisher officially.Country House became the first horse to win the Derby on an objection; Dancer’s Image was disqualified in 1968 after a post-race urinalysis found traces of a banned substance, and Forward Pass was declared the winner.“If it were a maiden claiming race on a weekday, the winner would come down,” Country House’s trainer, Bill Mott, told NBC as he anxiously awaited the stewards’ decision with the 150,729 in attendance and the countless others watching at home.Once in the winner’s circle, a smiling if a bit stunned Mott, a Hall of Famer, acknowledged it was an odd way to capture his first Derby win. “We’ll just have to prove ourselves in the future,” he said."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-4-missandei-recap.html","There were plenty of broken hearts to go around Sunday on “Game of Thrones.”There was Brienne, who realized her longstanding dream of bedding the Kingslayer, only to have all her feelings slain soon after.Gendry, buoyed by his new nobility, showed how little he knows Arya by asking her to be his lady, and received the predictable reply. “That’s not me,” she said, this season’s latest callback to the earliest chapters of this story. (Seriously, Gendry? You think she saved the human race last week so she could host parties at Storm’s End?)[Read our ultimate guide to “Game of Thrones.” | Sign up for our Watching newsletter for film and TV recommendations.]Then there was Grey Worm, who saw his beloved Missandei lose her head in one of the show’s crueler executions. I knew the Naath love nest they dreamed about a couple weeks ago would never come to pass, but figured (hoped?) it would be Grey Worm’s end that prevented it.But it was the other primary witness to Missandei’s death whose broken heart will have the most world-shattering repercussions.That would be Daenerys, who lost not only her most trusted confidante this week but also her dragon Rhaegal, who had survived having his wing tattered in the White Walker battle only to get shot out of the sky, thanks to the Euron fleet’s exceptional marksmanship. (I guess while we’ve been in Winterfell for the past two weeks, they’ve been taking target practice on the Scorpion range.)It was a bad week for the Dragon Queen, the latest in a fairly regular string of tragedy and indignity that began roughly when she started hanging out with Jon and doesn’t suggest much in the way of a happy ending.Sunday’s episode opened where we ended last week, with Dany weeping over a dead Jorah, her second most trusted confidante. The Long Night over, the sun had risen — insert your own “Battle of Winterfell darkness” joke here — and the survivors paid flaming tribute to “the shields that guard the realms of men,” as Jon described the fallen heroes, in one of his better bits of oratory.It was time for the healing to begin, and also the refocusing, as the show pivoted from the White Walker clash we’ve been hearing about for awhile to the final one in King’s Landing. Soon there would be battle strategizing that somehow involved a glorified Risk board but not the guy — or whatever Bran is — who can warg into U-2 spy ravens. Soon this heroic band of brothers and sisters would scatter, Dany would find new torment and Tyrion would make more faulty plans.But first it was time to turn Winterfell into a party house from some ’80s teen comedy. Tormund sloshed wine everywhere except his actual mouth. Tyrion and Jaime played drinking games with Brienne and Podrick. (Another Season 1 callback.) Attractive young women fawned over schlubs. (Apparently Tormund and the Hound are irresistible to nubile young Northerners.) Everything — and everyone — got trashed. And, of course, it all ended with someone losing their virginity.There’s a certain segment of “Thrones” fans who wanted Brienne to pair off with Jaime, but I was not among them. I understand the heightened sex quotient of recent weeks — when you’re squaring off with death, a desire to embrace life seems natural. And Lord of Light knows, Brienne deserves some fun.But there’s something clichéd and regressive about this apparent need to bend every male-female onscreen relationship toward romance. Brienne and Jaime’s bond was endearing because it seemed to be based more on mutual admiration, a riff on the way some people can urge you toward your better self. Throwing sex into the mix doesn’t necessarily cheapen everything that’s come before, but it does make it less interesting.It seems to be over, at any rate, which was awkward for other reasons. Jaime had barely begun embracing his better self and Tyrion’s tall jokes before word of Cersei turned him into a sort of one-handed Manchurian Candidate heading back for King’s Landing.“She’s hateful, and so am I,” he told a sobbing Brienne. I know the show needs him to have a final showdown with his partner in twincest, but it felt pretty abrupt.Also abrupt: Sansa’s spilling of Jon’s secrets. Mere hours after swearing her secrecy and all the rhetoric about “the last of the Starks” sticking together, she was blabbing the most explosive revelation in the Known World to Tyrion, the person closest to the subject of said revelation.Sansa, no fan of Dany’s, presumably had her reasons. But at least one of those seemed to be “because the show needed the word to get out” — a development that, like Jaime’s departure, distracted by seeming to result more from narrative necessity than a character’s natural behavior.Whatever its origin, it’s yet another complicating factor for Daenerys in a season filled with same.You’ll recall how utterly indestructible Team Daenerys looked as it crossed the Narrow Sea at the end of Season 6. The occasional Loot Train Attack aside, much of the show since then has been about evening the odds between her and Cersei’s forces, with Dany losing Viserion, Greyjoy ships (at least twice now) and a bunch of Dothraki and Unsullied while Cersei gained Euron’s armada and about 20,000 Golden Company mercenaries.“The balance has grown distressingly even,” Varys noted Sunday, and that was before Rhaegal went down. (Imagine where things would stand now if Cersei’s elephants had come through.)This season there’s been a parallel effort to strip Daenerys down emotionally and back her in a corner, making her paradoxically more likely to go off even as she continues to lose firepower.Sansa has openly resented her, even after Dany paused her own aspirations in order to join the White Walker fight. Jon has a better claim on the Iron Throne than she does, and people like him better, too.She began this week mourning Jorah and ended it watching Missandei get decapitated. Along the way her boyfriend denied her pleas, her dragonbaby died, and her Hand hatched yet another plan — ask Cersei to surrender — that blew up in her face.Daenerys’s messianic qualities and single-minded throne lust have always made her a dicey candidate for realm-ruling. “I have served tyrants most of my life — they all talk about destiny,” Varys said, and he’s not wrong.But in Dany’s defense, how much more is the woman supposed to take? She seems done listening to anything aside from her own sense of justice. And if that means tens of thousands of King’s Landing innocents have the sky fall down upon them, so be it.The question is whether she’ll end up falling along with it.• Cersei is going to keep using this pregnancy gimmick until it stops working. But is that day coming soon? If you’re Euron, you’d probably wonder how Tyrion could know about Cersei’s impending arrival if he’s been away all this time.• Bronn finally showed up with the crossbow and his counteroffer, and left with yet another Lannister I.O.U.: Highgarden. (Castles were being doled out all over Winterfell.) Maybe Jaime can catch up with him on the way back to King’s Landing.[A Starbucks in Winterfell? Somehow, a modern disposable coffee cup appeared in Sunday’s episode.] • Also headed to King’s Landing: Jon, Grey Worm and their remaining army, and Arya and the Hound. By reuniting perhaps the best road duo of the show and portending a Cleganebowl (“some unfinished business”), it’s a two-for-one fan service deal, but I’m O.K. with it.• I alluded to it earlier, but Team Dany isn’t really into reconnaissance or military intelligence, huh? They might want to reconsider this strategy (or lack thereof) before they lose all their dragons.• “Dracarys!” Missandei said with her final breaths, a stirring call to arms that, in the context, translates essentially into “Burn them all!” Now where have I heard that before …• So was that the last time we saw Ghost, Tormund, Sam and Gilly? Gilly mocked Sam for trying to explain to Jon where babies come from, but I think in his own clumsy way, Sam was trying to brag.• And allow me to be the four millionth person to wonder how a man can fail to even pet the wolf he’ll never see again, especially one that apparently lost an ear fighting its owner’s battles.• “She’s his aunt,” Varys said. Thank you, Varys. Somebody had to say it.• So what do you think? Will Dany blow it all up next week? Is Jaime returning to join Cersei? Or kill her? What’s your favorite ’80s teen party movie? (I’m partial to “Weird Science” but none of them have aged very well.) Please fire away in the comments. (Dracarys!)"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/climate/biodiversity-extinction-united-nations.html","WASHINGTON — Humans are transforming Earth’s natural landscapes so dramatically that as many as one million plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, posing a dire threat to ecosystems that people all over the world depend on for their survival, a sweeping new United Nations assessment has concluded.The 1,500-page report, compiled by hundreds of international experts and based on thousands of scientific studies, is the most exhaustive look yet at the decline in biodiversity across the globe and the dangers that creates for human civilization. A summary of its findings, which was approved by representatives from the United States and 131 other countries, was released Monday in Paris. The full report is set to be published this year.Its conclusions are stark. In most major land habitats, from the savannas of Africa to the rain forests of South America, the average abundance of native plant and animal life has fallen by 20 percent or more, mainly over the past century. With the human population passing 7 billion, activities like farming, logging, poaching, fishing and mining are altering the natural world at a rate “unprecedented in human history.”At the same time, a new threat has emerged: Global warming has become a major driver of wildlife decline, the assessment found, by shifting or shrinking the local climates that many mammals, birds, insects, fish and plants evolved to survive in. As a result, biodiversity loss is projected to accelerate through 2050, particularly in the tropics, unless countries drastically step up their conservation efforts. The report is not the first to paint a grim portrait of Earth’s ecosystems. But it goes further by detailing how closely human well-being is intertwined with the fate of other species.“For a long time, people just thought of biodiversity as saving nature for its own sake,” said Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which conducted the assessment at the request of national governments. “But this report makes clear the links between biodiversity and nature and things like food security and clean water in both rich and poor countries.”A previous report by the group had estimated that, in the Americas, nature provides some $24 trillion of non-monetized benefits to humans each year. The Amazon rain forest absorbs immense quantities of carbon dioxide and helps slow the pace of global warming. Wetlands purify drinking water. Coral reefs sustain tourism and fisheries in the Caribbean. Exotic tropical plants form the basis of a variety of medicines.But as these natural landscapes wither and become less biologically rich, the services they can provide to humans have been dwindling. Humans are producing more food than ever, but land degradation is already harming agricultural productivity on 23 percent of the planet’s land area, the new report said. The decline of wild bees and other insects that help pollinate fruits and vegetables is putting up to $577 billion in annual crop production at risk. The loss of mangrove forests and coral reefs along coasts could expose up to 300 million people to increased risk of flooding.The authors note that the devastation of nature has become so severe that piecemeal efforts to protect individual species or to set up wildlife refuges will no longer be sufficient. Instead, they call for “transformative changes” that include curbing wasteful consumption, slimming down agriculture’s environmental footprint and cracking down on illegal logging and fishing.“It’s no longer enough to focus just on environmental policy,” said Sandra M. Díaz, a lead author of the study and an ecologist at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina. “We need to build biodiversity considerations into trade and infrastructure decisions, the way that health or human rights are built into every aspect of social and economic decision-making.”Scientists have cataloged only a fraction of living creatures, some 1.3 million; the report estimates there may be as many as 8 million plant and animal species on the planet, most of them insects. Since 1500, at least 680 species have blinked out of existence, including the Pinta giant tortoise of the Galápagos Islands and the Guam flying fox.Though outside experts cautioned it could be difficult to make precise forecasts, the report warns of a looming extinction crisis, with extinction rates currently tens to hundreds of times higher than they have been in the past 10 million years. “Human actions threaten more species with global extinction now than ever before,” the report concludes, estimating that “around 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades, unless action is taken.”Unless nations step up their efforts to protect what natural habitats are left, they could witness the disappearance of 40 percent of amphibian species, one-third of marine mammals and one-third of reef-forming corals. More than 500,000 land species, the report said, do not have enough natural habitat left to ensure their long-term survival.Over the past 50 years, global biodiversity loss has primarily been driven by activities like the clearing of forests for farmland, the expansion of roads and cities, logging, hunting, overfishing, water pollution and the transport of invasive species around the globe.In Indonesia, the replacement of rain forest with palm oil plantations has ravaged the habitat of critically endangered orangutans and Sumatran tigers. In Mozambique, ivory poachers helped kill off nearly 7,000 elephants between 2009 and 2011 alone. In Argentina and Chile, the introduction of the North American beaver in the 1940s has devastated native trees (though it has also helped other species thrive, including the Magellanic woodpecker). All told, three-quarters of the world’s land area has been significantly altered by people, the report found, and 85 percent of the world’s wetlands have vanished since the 18th century.And with humans continuing to burn fossil fuels for energy, global warming is expected to compound the damage. Roughly 5 percent of species worldwide are threatened with climate-related extinction if global average temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the report concluded. (The world has already warmed 1 degree.)“If climate change were the only problem we were facing, a lot of species could probably move and adapt,” Richard Pearson, an ecologist at the University College of London, said. “But when populations are already small and losing genetic diversity, when natural landscapes are already fragmented, when plants and animals can’t move to find newly suitable habitats, then we have a real threat on our hands.”The dwindling number of species will not just make the world a less colorful or wondrous place, the report noted. It also poses risks to people.Today, humans are relying on significantly fewer varieties of plants and animals to produce food. Of the 6,190 domesticated mammal breeds used in agriculture, more than 559 have gone extinct and 1,000 more are threatened. That means the food system is becoming less resilient against pests and diseases. And it could become harder in the future to breed new, hardier crops and livestock to cope with the extreme heat and drought that climate change will bring.“Most of nature’s contributions are not fully replaceable,” the report said. Biodiversity loss “can permanently reduce future options, such as wild species that might be domesticated as new crops and be used for genetic improvement.”The report does contain glimmers of hope. When governments have acted forcefully to protect threatened species, such as the Arabian oryx or the Seychelles magpie robin, they have managed to fend off extinction in many cases. And nations have protected more than 15 percent of the world’s land and 7 percent of its oceans by setting up nature reserves and wilderness areas.Still, only a fraction of the most important areas for biodiversity have been protected, and many nature reserves poorly enforce prohibitions against poaching, logging or illegal fishing. Climate change could also undermine existing wildlife refuges by shifting the geographic ranges of species that currently live within them.So, in addition to advocating the expansion of protected areas, the authors outline a vast array of changes aimed at limiting the drivers of biodiversity loss. Farmers and ranchers would have to adopt new techniques to grow more food on less land. Consumers in wealthy countries would have to waste less food and become more efficient in their use of natural resources. Governments around the world would have to strengthen and enforce environmental laws, cracking down on illegal logging and fishing and reducing the flow of heavy metals and untreated wastewater into the environment.The authors also note that efforts to limit global warming will be critical, although they caution that the development of biofuels to reduce emissions could end up harming biodiversity by further destroying forests.None of this will be easy, especially since many developing countries face pressure to exploit their natural resources as they try to lift themselves out of poverty. But, by detailing the benefits that nature can provide to people, and by trying to quantify what is lost when biodiversity plummets, the scientists behind the assessment are hoping to help governments strike a more careful balance between economic development and conservation.“You can’t just tell leaders in Africa that there can’t be any development and that we should turn the whole continent into a national park,” said Emma Archer, who led the group’s earlier assessment of biodiversity in Africa. “But we can show that there are trade-offs, that if you don’t take into account the value that nature provides, then ultimately human well-being will be compromised.”In the next two years, diplomats from around the world will gather for several meetings under the Convention on Biological Diversity, a global treaty, to discuss how they can step up their efforts at conservation. Yet even in the new report’s most optimistic scenario, through 2050 the world’s nations would only slow the decline of biodiversity — not stop it.“At this point,” said Jake Rice, a fisheries scientist who led an earlier report on biodiversity in the Americas, “our options are all about damage control.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump reversed himself on Sunday and said that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, should not testify before Congress, setting up a potentially explosive confrontation with Democrats over presidential authority and the separation of powers.The president argued on Twitter that Mr. Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election — which found no conspiracy between Moscow and Mr. Trump’s campaign but did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice — was conclusive and that Congress and the American people did not need to hear from Mr. Mueller. “Bob Mueller should not testify,” he said. “No redos for the Dems!”On Friday, Mr. Trump had said it was up to Attorney General William P. Barr whether Mr. Mueller testified. The president’s about-face now puts new pressure on Mr. Barr, who must decide whether to accede to Mr. Trump’s call. Last week, Mr. Barr said he had no objection to Mr. Mueller testifying.The conflict over Mr. Mueller escalates Mr. Trump’s fight with Democrats just as his re-election campaign is taking shape. It comes on top of numerous refusals by the administration to turn over records to Congress, including a request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns. Mr. Trump has also balked at testimony from his former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II.Still, the confrontation over Mr. Mueller, however much it antagonizes Democrats, could be short-lived. Mr. Mueller, who as special counsel is an employee of the Justice Department, is likely to finish his work this month. After that, any decision to testify before Congress would not be constrained by Mr. Barr, assuming the White House does not try to stop him by some other means, possibly through the courts.Throughout the two-year investigation, Mr. Mueller has said virtually nothing in public. Democrats have insisted that Mr. Mueller is the best person to provide a detailed interpretation of the 448-page report that he delivered in March to Mr. Barr, and on Sunday, they vowed to press ahead.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, criticized the president, saying he “repeatedly tried to fire Mueller, then he refused to be interviewed by Mueller.”“Now he’s trying to silence Mueller,” he said, adding, “Mueller must testify publicly before Congress.”The House Judiciary Committee formally invited Mr. Mueller to testify last month and has been negotiating details of a possible appearance on May 15, but no date has been confirmed. Separately, the House Intelligence Committee has also invited Mr. Mueller to answer questions.Two people close to Mr. Trump said he had been moving toward an objection to Mr. Mueller testifying over the last few days as a counter to the call from some Democrats to impeach Mr. Barr for how he handled his own testimony last week to Congress.But some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have warned that he risks turning Mr. Mueller into a martyred figure if he demands that he not testify. Others close to the president say he is making a mistake for a different reason in trying to restrain Mr. Mueller.The special counsel, they say, would most likely face tough questions from Republicans about two F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who in text exchanges were deeply critical of Mr. Trump as they were investigating Russian interference in the election. Those questions would undercut Mr. Mueller’s investigation, those close to the president say, and allow them to paint it as a partisan attack on Mr. Trump.Mr. Barr, during a hearing about the report before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, was pressed on whether Mr. Mueller should be allowed to testify.“I’ve already said publicly I have no objection to him testifying,” Mr. Barr responded.By Sunday, the president did have an objection. “Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion?” Mr. Trump tweeted. “There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION.”Democrats say it is essential to hear from Mr. Mueller given the friction between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Barr over how the report has been characterized.After Mr. Mueller delivered his report to Mr. Barr in March, the attorney general issued a four-page summary in which he said there was no finding of collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. But he also quoted Mr. Mueller saying he could not exonerate the president on the obstruction issue.Mr. Mueller then wrote a letter to Mr. Barr complaining that his relatively short rendering of the lengthy report lacked context and full explanation. Last week, Mr. Barr called the letter “snitty” during his Senate testimony.Mr. Trump and many of his allies have pushed the theme that Mr. Mueller’s report spoke for itself, and that there is no need for additional hearings or testimony. They say Congress should not only move on, but focus its oversight efforts on whether Democrats had even more troubling ties to possible Russian interference.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is among several supporters of the president who have tried to close the book on the Mueller inquiry by saying simply, “It’s over.”Mr. Graham, however, did open a small window to hear from Mr. Mueller, saying that if the special counsel thought that Mr. Barr had mischaracterized a conversation with him during his congressional testimony, then he would offer the chance for him to clarify the matter before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter on April 8 to the committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, asking that Mr. Mueller testify.“I write encouraging you to invite Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III to testify before our Committee without delay. If you seek both transparency and for the American public to learn the full contours of the Special Counsel’s investigation, public testimony from Special Counsel Mueller himself is undoubtedly the best way to accomplish this goal,” Mr. Collins wrote.A spokeswoman for Mr. Collins said on Sunday that he still wanted Mr. Mueller to testify.The effects of the Mueller investigation continued to weigh on the president into Sunday evening.“Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stollen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back,” he said in another tweet."

And yet I was the one who found myself in charge of managing the details of our children’s lives.Too often I’d spend frantic days looking for spring break child care only to hear him ask, “Oh, there’s no school tomorrow?” Or we’d arrive home late with two tired kids, and instead of spearheading their nighttime routine he’d disappear to brush his own teeth. Unless I pointed out these lapses (which he’ll tell you I often did, and I’ll tell you I often did not), he was unaware.We’ve all heard this story before. Thinking about my own relationship, and watching the other couples I knew, I kept wondering: Why is this still happening?The optimistic tale of the modern, involved dad has been greatly exaggerated. The amount of child care men performed rose throughout the 1980s and ’90s, but then began to level off without ever reaching parity. Mothers still shoulder 65 percent of child-care work. In academic journals, family researchers caution that the “culture of fatherhood” has changed more than fathers’ actual behavior.Sociologists attribute the discrepancy between mothers’ expectations and reality to “a largely successful male resistance.” This resistance is not being led by socially conservative men, whose like-minded wives often explicitly agree to take the lead in the home. It is happening, instead, with relatively progressive couples, and it takes many women — who thought their partners had made a prenatal commitment to equal parenting — by surprise. Why are their partners failing to pitch in more?[The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.]The answer lies, in part, in the different ways that men and women typically experience unfairness. Inequality makes everyone feel bad. Studies have found that people who feel they’re getting away with something experience fear and self-reproach, while people who feel exploited are angry and resentful. And yet men are more comfortable than women with the first scenario and less tolerant than women of finding themselves with the short end of the stick. Parity is hard, and this discrepancy lays the groundwork for male resistance.Though many men are in denial about it, their resistance communicates a feeling of entitlement to women’s labor. Men resist because it is in their “interest to do so,” write Scott Coltrane and Michele Adams, leaders in the field of family studies, in their book, “Gender and Families.” By passively refusing to take an equal role, men are reinforcing “a separation of spheres that underpins masculine ideals and perpetuates a gender order privileging men over women.”While interviewing working parents for a book on parenthood, I spoke with one dad in Vermont who said: “The expectation among my male friends is still that they will have the life they had before having kids. My dad has never cooked a meal. I’ve strayed from that. But subconsciously, the thing that makes you motivationally step up and do something when you’re not being asked …” he trailed off, and then said: “I have justifications. It’s a cop-out.”Take love out of the equation and focus on the workplace, and it’s clear how this plays out. Studies show that male employees sit back while their female co-workers perform the tasks that don’t lead to promotion. In a series of lab studies, the economists Lise Vesterlund, Linda Babcock and Maria Recalde and the organizational behaviorist Laurie Weingart found that in coed groups, women are 50 percent more likely than men to volunteer to take on work that no one else wants to do. But in all-male groups, the men volunteer just as readily.In an interview with NPR, Dr. Vesterlund explained that the women do the work “because they’re expected to.” The men “come into the room, they see the women, they know how we play these games.”We play the same games at home. I interviewed couples separately and found that the women were often angry, while many men didn’t seem to realize there was a problem.“She felt like we were really in it together,” a father of teenagers told me — after I spoke with his long-frustrated wife.The couples offered three explanations for this labor imbalance. The first was that women take over activities like bedtime, homework and laundry because men perform these tasks inadequately. But this isn’t “maternal gatekeeping,” the theory that men want to help but women disparage their capabilities and push them out. Instead these seem to be situations that necessitate the intervention of a reasonable adult.A mother in California said: “It’s important to me that my sons are not falling asleep in class and that they’re not late for school. My husband does not share those priorities, so I do bedtime and school drop-off.”The dad in Vermont explained: “I do laundry when I need it. When it comes to the kids’ laundry, I could be more proactive, but instead I operate on my time scale. So my wife does most of their laundry. Let me do it my way and I’m happy to do it, but if you’re going to tell me how to do it, go ahead and do it yourself.”The second explanation involved forgetting or obliviousness. A mother in Illinois said: “My husband is a participatory and willing partner. He’s not traditional in terms of ‘I don’t change diapers.’ But his attention is limited.” She added, “I can’t trust him to do anything, to actually remember.”A dad in San Francisco said that many of the tasks of parenting weren’t important enough to remember: “I just don’t think these things are worth attending to. A certain percentage of parental involvement that my wife does, I would see as valuable but unnecessary. A lot of disparity in our participation is that.”Finally, some men blamed their wives’ personalities. A San Diego dad said his wife did more because she was so uptight. “She wakes up on a Saturday morning and has a list. I don’t keep lists. I think there’s a belief that if she’s not going to do it, then it won’t get done.” (His wife agreed that this was true, but emphasized that her belief was based on experience: “We fell into this easy pattern where he learned to be oblivious and I learned to resent him.”)A father in Portland, Ore., confirmed that his wife takes on more but said: “It has to do with her personality. She always has to stay busy. No matter what day of the week it is, she has a need to be engaged, to be doing something.”Many mothers told me they had tried to change this and had aired their grievances with their partners, only to watch as nothing changed. A mother in Queens said she spent three years trying to get her husband to do more before coming to terms with the fact that maybe it was never going to happen. “He notices the unfairness, but he just accepts it as something we have a disagreement about,” she said. “How much convincing of the other person can you do?”All this comes at a cost to women’s well-being, as mothers forgo leisure time, professional ambitions and sleep. Wives who view their household responsibilities “as unjust are more likely to suffer from depression than those who do not,” one study says. When their children are young, employed women (but not men) take a hit to their health as well as to their earnings — and the latter never recovers. Child-care imbalances also tank relationship happiness, especially in the early years of parenthood.Division of labor in the home is one of the most important gender-equity issues of our time. Yet at the current rate of change, MenCare, a group that promotes equal involvement in caregiving, estimates that it will be about 75 more years before men worldwide assume half of the unpaid work that domesticity requires. If anything is going to change, men have to stop resisting. Gendered parenting is kept alive by the unacknowledged power bestowed upon men in a world that values their needs, comforts and desires more than women’s. It’s up to fathers to cop to this, rather than to cop out."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/key-fobs-north-olmsted-ohio.html","It sounded like something from an episode of “The X-Files”: Starting a few weeks ago, in a suburban neighborhood a few miles from a NASA research center in Ohio, garage door openers and car key fobs mysteriously stopped working.Garage door repair people, local ham radio enthusiasts and other volunteer investigators descended on the neighborhood with various meters. Everyone agreed that something powerful was interfering with the radio frequency that many fobs rely on, but no one could identify the source.Officials of North Olmsted, a city just outside Cleveland, began receiving calls about the problems in late April, Donald Glauner, the safety and service director for North Olmsted, said on Saturday.In the weeks that followed, more than a dozen residents reported intermittent issues getting their car fobs and garage door openers to work. Most lived within a few blocks of one another in North Olmsted, though some were from the nearby city of Fairview Park.Not every car fob failed to work, said Chris Branchick, whose parents live in North Olmsted. He said that whenever he visited his parents in his GMC vehicle, the fob would not unlock the car door; if he went in his fiancée’s Nissan, things were fine.“We thought maybe it was a foreign versus domestic thing,” he said.Officials from the cable company and AT&T joined the search for answers, and on Thursday, the Illuminating Company, a local electric utility, dispatched inspectors to investigate.“They began by shutting off the power in the places where they detected the strongest reading for interfering radio frequencies,” said Chris Eck, a company spokesman. But even after shutting off power on an entire block, the overpowering frequency persisted.“It’s like trying to talk to someone at a nightclub,” said Adam Scott Wandt, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, in explaining how a strong frequency can derail a weak frequency.Dan Dalessandro, a television repairman, was one of several ham radio aficionados who went to investigate. At first, he said, all he picked up were “little blips” on a signal detector, but on one block — and at one house in particular — the signal was extraordinarily powerful.By Saturday afternoon, City Councilman Chris Glassburn announced that the mystery had been solved: The source of the problem was a homemade battery-operated device designed by a local resident to alert him if someone was upstairs when he was working in his basement. It did so by turning off a light.“He has a fascination with electronics,” Mr. Glassburn said, adding that the resident has special needs and would not be identified to protect his privacy.The inventor and other residents of his home had no idea that the device was wreaking havoc on the neighborhood, he said, until Mr. Glassburn and a volunteer with expertise in radio frequencies knocked on the door.“The way he designed it, it was persistently putting out a 315 megahertz signal,” Mr. Glassburn said. That is the frequency many car fobs and garage door openers rely on.“There was no malicious intent of the device,” he said in a statement.The battery on the device was removed and the signal stopped. “It was a relief,” Mr. Glassburn said.More broadly, the case is a reminder of the power of radio frequencies, Professor Wandt said.“They are not inherently dangerous to a human being,” he said. “But they could cause mass chaos in our technologically advanced society in ways we cannot predict.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/world/asia/cyclone-fani-india-evacuations.html","BHUBANESWAR, India — Flights were canceled.Train service was out.And one of the biggest storms in years was bearing down on Odisha, one of India’s poorest states, where millions of people live cheek by jowl in a low-lying coastal area in mud-and-stick shacks.But government authorities in Odisha, along India’s eastern flank, hardly stood still. To warn people of what was coming, they deployed everything they had: 2.6 million text messages, 43,000 volunteers, nearly 1,000 emergency workers, television commercials, coastal sirens, buses, police officers, and public address systems blaring the same message on a loop, in local language, in very clear terms: “A cyclone is coming. Get to the shelters.”[Update: “The worst is over”: A sigh of relief in India, mostly spared by cyclone.]It seems to have largely worked. Cyclone Fani slammed into Odisha on Friday morning with the force of a major hurricane, packing 120 mile per hour winds. Trees were ripped from the ground and many coastal shacks smashed. It could have been catastrophic.But as of early Saturday, mass casualties seemed to have been averted. While the full extent of the destruction remained unclear, only a few deaths had been reported, in what appeared to be an early-warning success story.The most vulnerable people, it seemed, had gotten out of the way.Experts say this is a remarkable achievement, especially in a poor state in a developing country, the product of a meticulous evacuation plan in which the authorities, sobered by past tragedies, moved a million people to safety, really fast.“Few would have expected this kind of organizational efficiency,” said Abhijit Singh, a former naval officer and head of the Maritime Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a research organization. “It is a major success.”The storm also hit neighboring Bangladesh, but there, too, large numbers of casualties were avoided by evacuating more than one million people to shelters.This is so different from 20 years ago, when a fearsome cyclone blasted into this same area and obliterated villages, killing thousands. Many people were caught flat-footed in their homes. Some of the dead were found miles from where they had lived, dragged away by raging cascades.After that, the Odisha authorities vowed to ensure a disaster like that never felled them again.“We have a very serious commitment on this — there should not be any loss of life,” said Bishnupada Sethi, the state’s special relief commissioner, who has been supervising the operation. “This is not the work of a day or a month but of 20 years.”One of the first steps taken after the 1999 disaster was the construction of hundreds of cyclone shelters up and down the coast. The shelters are built up to a few miles from the seashore.They aren’t picturesque — picture a bare two-story, peeling-paint, cement-block rectangular building on stilts, almost resembling a crab. But the structures, designed by the faculty at one of India’s elite universities, I.I.T. Kharagpur, have proved storm-worthy.Over the past week, even when Fani was hundreds of miles away, the Indian authorities had been closely watching. They had first picked up a large swirl on meteorological radar screens barreling up from the Equator, deep in the ocean between Sri Lanka and Indonesia.It was not yet a cyclone, but rather what meteorologists call a deep depression — a spiraling low-pressure storm that sucks in warm air. As it moves across warm waters, like those in the Bay of Bengal, the storm strengthens.By midweek, Fani had become a cyclone. Meteorologists accurately predicted its path. For days, they have been saying it would head straight up the Bay of Bengal and make landfall in Odisha.The state of Odisha has around 46 million people, about the population of Spain, but many times poorer. The average income is less than $5 a day. The majority of people are farmers.Along the coast, many men work on wooden fishing boats. As Fani approached, the boats were ordered ashore.On Thursday morning, Odisha government officials released a five-page action plan. They seemed to have left nothing uncovered. The most important part was to get people to the shelters. Since Odisha has been hit by many killer storms, state emergency officers said they had drilled on their evacuation plans many times.All emergency personnel were ordered to district operation centers. Government workers drafted lists of people in vulnerable houses, particularly the elderly and children.Tourists at coastal hotels were advised to leave and an enormous amount of equipment was readied to deal with the storm’s aftermath, including 300 power boats, two helicopters and many chain saws, to cut downed trees.At the same time, truckloads of food and bottled water were delivered to the shelters.As the sea turned frothy on Thursday afternoon and the rain began to fall, the loudspeakers blared messages telling people to go to the nearest shelter as soon as possible.In some areas, there was no choice. Police officers escorted the emergency workers who moved through the coastal towns, exhorting people to leave. Packed buses chugged up and down the roads around Puri, a coastal town that was predicted to get walloped. Each shelter can hold several hundred people. They quickly filled.“We moved here because it is safe,” said Sabakali Mason, a man in his 50s who waited inside a shelter with his wife. “Our house may collapse.”By Thursday night, most shelters were bustling concentrations of humanity, full of men, women and slightly dazed children. Some people had walked to them; others had been scooped up by the free government buses. Families sat on the floors, eating together, listening to Fani’s winds pick up speed.Around 9 a.m. Friday, Fani screamed ashore, the eye passing near Puri, as predicted. In Bhubaneswar, Odisha’s state capital, about 40 miles north, huge tree limbs snapped in the lashing rain. No one ventured outside.In Puri, the winds wrecked just about all the roadside kiosks. Officials said the gusts reached at least 100 m.p.h. They will never know, they said, because the gusts knocked down the machine that measures the wind.The Odisha authorities said more than 100 people were injured. Indian news media reported several people had died, including some killed by flying debris.Many people, even if they hadn’t lost their lives, lost their livelihoods.“Nature punishes the poor people more and spares the rich,” said S.K. Behra, the owner of a smashed tea stall in Bhubaneswar. “What can I do? I am helpless. Slowly I will rebuild my life again.”But as the storm weakened and the worst seemed over, there was little doubt that the high level of preparedness had saved lives.“The government is usually dysfunctional in cases like this but the whole mobilization was quite impressive,” said Mr. Singh, the former naval officer. “Evacuating a million people in three or four days and providing them with not just shelter but also food is a big achievement in such a short time.”Krishan Kumar, an officer in the Khordha district of the Odisha government, said the government’s success reflected an accumulated wisdom.“Every small cyclone or tsunami teaches you how to deal with the bigger ones,” he said. “If you don’t learn from the past experiences, you will drown.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/sports/kentucky-derby-live.html","LOUISVILLE, Ky. — This has not been horse racing’s finest hour: dead horses at Santa Anita Park and consternation among horse people that they can treat their athletes better but have failed to do so. It’s little wonder then that the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday ended in astonishment, controversy and confusion.The Kentucky Derby, much like the Super Bowl, has become a place to see and be seen. Celebrities and wealthy people are everywhere, making the weekend a party with a race as the main distraction. On Saturday, Maximum Security won America’s most famous race on the track. Until he didn’t. For the first time in the history of the race, the horse who crossed the finish line first was disqualified for interference and stripped of his title, before a stunned crowd of more than 150,000.By all appearances, Maximum Security had outrun the field, remaining unbeaten and giving a hard-knocking trainer from the Mid-Atlantic, Jason Servis, and his up-and-coming jockey, Luis Saez, their first Derby victories.[A day later, people are still trying to figure out how horse racing moves on]But there was a problem — a big one. Maximum Security had jumped a puddle on the rain-soaked track and slid to the outside, not only impeding the progress of a rival, War of Will, but also forcing that colt’s rider, Tyler Gaffalione, to squeeze his knees and wrangle the reins just to stay aboard.So the racing stewards went to watch the video for five minutes, then 10 minutes, then nearly 22.“Leave it to the racing gods,” an increasingly anguished Servis said as he awaited the stewards’ decision.Not far away, Bill Mott, a Hall of Fame trainer, looked on placidly. His colt, Country House, had finished second. Mott was trackside and said on national television what horseplayers know, dread and curse on a regular basis.“There was definitely a foul in the race,” Mott said. “If this was a maiden claimer on a weekday the winner would come down.”Down came Maximum Security and up went Country House, a 65-1 improbable victor. It was not a popular decision, but it was a brave one that is certain to keep a battered old sport in the national consciousness for a little bit longer. Never before had a foul voided an apparent win at the Derby. One other horse has been stripped of victory: In 1968 a failed drug test led to the disqualification of Dancer’s Image days after the race, when Forward Pass was named the winner.This was the first Derby triumph for Mott, a horseman revered among his peers for being “half-horse,” as it was for Flavien Prat, a Frenchman who is now based in California. He has learned his lessons well here because it was his objection that set off the video scrutiny and ultimately changed (and made) history.After Maximum Security finished one and three-quarter lengths in front of Country House, it appeared the racing officials had either not seen the purported foul or did not think Maximum Security had kept a better horse from winning.But Prat protested — it is called an objection in racetrack parlance — meaning that the officials had to hear from him what happened and review the video. It was a crafty request, especially after Prat acknowledged that it was doubtful he and Country House were ever going to catch Maximum Security.“It kind of turned me sideways,” he said. “It was at the quarter pole and affected my momentum.”Mott, however, was more diplomatic about his rider’s complaint.“It may have affected it slightly, but it affected two other horses dramatically,” he said.Barbara Borden, chief steward for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, would not take questions about the stewards’ decision, but said that they had determined that Maximum Security had “drifted out” and impeded Country House as well.The stakes were already high on Saturday for a declining sport that has quickly become an endangered one. Twenty-three horse deaths over a three-month span at Santa Anita Park in Southern California shut down racing there and produced calls to ban the sport.Here at Churchill Downs, 43 thoroughbreds were lost to racing injuries since 2016, an average of 2.42 per 1,000 starts, which was 50 percent higher than the national average during the same time.So it was with racing hearts and fraught nerves that the crowd of 150,729 sent off the field of 19 horses on a rainy day that left the racetrack as sticky as peanut butter and the horses and riders determined to find safe and strategic footing.It looked like Saez had guided Maximum Security to a winning path. He had the only undefeated horse in the field, and they bounded out of the gate and led the way into the first turn. The plan was to rocket Maximum Security to the lead and make the others catch him. If they could.He was in front through a fast half-mile of 46.62 seconds. Behind him, Prat and Country House were splashing along unhurried in eighth place. As Maximum Security turned for home, he skipped over a puddle, banging War of Will and setting off a chain reaction that broke the stride of Code of Honor and a couple of others.“My horse shied away from the noise of the crowd and may have ducked out a little,” Saez said.Mott believed him.“I don’t think Luis Saez did anything intentionally. He is an inexperienced horse,” said Mott, who considers Saez a friend.The trainer also knows Servis well.“My heart actually aches for them, but that’s the way it is,” he said. “I’ve been on the other end of it plenty of times, but just not in the Kentucky Derby.”As for Servis, he went from celebrating the biggest victory in his career to something close to despair. His younger brother John won this race with Smarty Jones in 2004 and now he was about to join him in the record books as the only brothers to train Derby champions.“I’m just trying to hold it together,” he said on television after he thought he had won.But the three stewards and, yes, the racing gods, decided he, Saez and a game Maximum Security belonged in the record books.“It’s tough,” Servis said. “It hasn’t sunk in yet, but it will.”Bettors call what Servis and Saez — and often themselves — endure a tough beat. This may be one of the toughest of all, one that the most casual horse fan will be talking about for years to come.Alas, it was someone else’s day.The record book will say that Country House won the mile-and-a-quarter race and collected a $1.86 million check for his owners and paid a whopping $132.40 for a $2 bet.“It’s bittersweet,” Mott said. Then he paused, and a smile crept into the corners of his mouth. “You always want to win with a clean trip and have the horse recognized as the great athlete that he is. So yeah, it diminishes it. I know they had a very tough decision. I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes. With all that said, I’m damn glad they put up our number.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/smarter-living/the-case-for-doing-nothing.html","Keeping busy?Running from place to place and laboring over long to-do lists have increasingly become ways to communicate status: I’m so busy because I’m just so important, the thinking goes. Perhaps it’s time to stop all this busyness. Being busy — if we even are busy — is rarely the status indicator we’ve come to believe it is. Nonetheless, the impact is real, and instances of burnout, anxiety disorders and stress-related diseases are on the rise, not to mention millennial burnout.There’s a way out of that madness, and it’s not more mindfulness, exercise or a healthy diet (though these things are all still important). What we’re talking about is … doing nothing. Or, as the Dutch call it, niksen.It’s difficult to define what doing nothing is, because we are always doing something, even when we’re asleep.Doreen Dodgen-Magee, a psychologist who studies boredom and wrote the book “Deviced! Balancing Life and Technology in a Digital World,” likens niksen to a car whose engine is running but isn’t going anywhere.“The way I think about boredom is coming to a moment with no plan other than just to be,” she said.Sandi Mann, a psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire in Britain, added that niksen can be “when we’re not doing the things we should be doing. Because perhaps we don’t want to, we’re not motivated. Instead, we’re not doing very much.”More practically, the idea of niksen is to take conscious, considered time and energy to do activities like gazing out of a window or sitting motionless. The less-enlightened might call such activities “lazy” or “wasteful.” Again: nonsense.We at Smarter Living have long been fans of taking regular breaks throughout the day, as study after study shows that feeling drowsy, exhausted or otherwise mentally depleted during the workday drastically hinders performance and productivity.In other words: Whether at home or at work, permission granted to spend the afternoon just hanging out.Generally speaking, our culture does not promote sitting still, and that can have wide-reaching consequences for our mental health, well-being, productivity and other areas of our lives. Technology doesn’t make it any easier: The smartphone you carry with you at all hours makes it almost impossible to truly unplug and embrace idleness. And by keeping ourselves busy at all times, we may be losing our ability to sit still because our brains are actually being rewired.Indeed, the benefits of idleness can be wide-ranging.Ms. Mann’s research has found that daydreaming — an inevitable effect of idleness — “literally makes us more creative, better at problem-solving, better at coming up with creative ideas.” For that to happen, though, total idleness is required.“Let the mind search for its own stimulation,” Ms. Mann said. “That’s when you get the daydreaming and mind wandering, and that’s when you’re more likely to get the creativity.”[Like what you’re reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]Counterintuitively, idleness can be a great productivity tool because “if our energy is totally shot, our productivity is not going to be good because we’re not going to have fuel to burn with which to be productive,” said Chris Bailey, a productivity expert and author of the blog “A Life of Productivity.”Niksen can help you solve problems as well. “It takes you out of your mind, and then you see things clearly after a while,” said Manfred Kets de Vries, a professor of leadership development and organizational change at Insead in Paris.But stopping the cycle of business can be challenging in a culture that prizes getting things done. Here are some tips to help you stop and be:Figure out when you’re most productive and creative, then notice when your mind starts to shut off or you start performing tasks just for the sake of doing them, Mr. Bailey suggests. That’s when you should go for a walk or take a break. The intention behind the decision is what counts.“I do nothing with purpose,” Mr. Kets de Vries said. “I know that without breaks I cannot be effective.” Prioritize the things that are important to you and the things that bring you pleasure, and outsource everything else when possible. Focusing on the truly relevant parts of life can help you build free time in your schedule. And take advantage of convenient opportunities to practice idleness, like when you’re standing in line or waiting for the children to come home from school.If you’re doing nothing, own it. When someone asks you what you’re doing during a nothing break, simply respond, “Nothing.” Be unapologetic about taking breaks or holidays, and if you start to feel guilty about being seen as lazy, think of niksen not as a sign of laziness but as an important life skill. Choose the initial discomfort of niksen over the familiarity of busyness.Learning takes time and effort, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t catch on immediately to the benefits of idleness. Know that sitting still might actually be uncomfortable at first and might take practice — just like exercise.Ms. Dodgen-Magee likens it to beginning a new workout routine: At first, you might get sore, but “after a while, you’ll find yourself in this moment where you’re like, ‘Oh, this feels fantastic.’”Your surroundings can have a major impact on how much nothingness you can embrace, so consider the physical space in your home and workplace. Keep your devices out of reach so that they’ll be more difficult to access, and turn your home into a niksen-friendly area. Add a soft couch, a comfy armchair, a few cushions or just a blanket. Orient furniture around a window or fireplace rather than a TV.“If those spaces are present, people will use them,” Ms. Dodgen-Magee said.If you can’t sit still in your home or workplace, go to the park or book a relaxing day at the spa. Ms. Dodgen-Magee encourages people to host boredom parties, during which a host invites over a few friends to … be bored together.Mr. Bailey suggests experimenting with different lifestyles to find the right one for you. For example, he lived like a slob for a week and learned that it’s important to “let the air out of the tires” once in a while.If you’re still uncomfortable with the idea of doing nothing, try to trick your mind into thinking you’re being productive. Ms. Dodgen-Magee suggests using open-end toys such as kinetic sand, Baoding balls or marble runs."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/europe/nurse-marathon-dress-guinness.html","LONDON — When Jessica Anderson joined more than 40,000 runners for the 2019 London Marathon last week, she had a goal in mind: Break the Guinness World Record for the fastest woman to run the marathon in a nurse’s uniform.Ms. Anderson, a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, crossed the finish line in 3 hours 8 minutes 22 seconds, beating the record set in 2015 by Sarah Dudgeon by 32 seconds.Record accomplished? Not so fast.Guinness rejected the record because Ms. Anderson did not wear a dress, she said in an interview on Sunday. Ms. Anderson had run the London Marathon in blue, baggy scrubs — the uniform she wears as a nurse with the National Health Service — to raise money for her unit’s charity fund.“They said it had to be a white or blue dress, pinafore apron and white cap or it wouldn’t count as a record,” Ms. Anderson said in an Instagram message on Sunday.“I didn’t want to wear that, so I chose to wear my real uniform instead because the title of the record is ‘fastest marathon in a nurse’s uniform,’” she added. “But was still aiming for the record time.”Ms. Anderson also told the website Runner’s World on Friday: “I’m sure Guinness World Records don’t intend to cause offense, but it would be nice if they decided to revise their criteria instead of reinforcing old gender stereotypes. I get that it’s supposed to be a fun thing, but their definition is just so outdated.”She also noted, “I’ve certainly never seen a male nurse wearing a dress to work.”Ms. Dudgeon, the record-holder, ran the 2015 London Marathon in a nurse’s outfit that included an apron and a Red Cross cap. It is not clear whether she worked as a nurse.That Ms. Anderson was denied credit for her feat because of what many saw as a sexist, outdated criteria spurred social media users and nurses to share pictures of real-life nurses’ uniforms on Twitter under the hashtag “What Nurses Wear.”Dozens of nurses — men and women alike — posted photographs of themselves in white, blue, dark red and purple scrubs, generally a two-piece outfit with pants.“Nursing is about the care we deliver not the uniform we wear,” Samantha Knipe said in a tweet.Scott Westwater, a student nurse, asked whether Guinness World Records would “dismiss this nurse if she happened to be male instead of female.” He added, “You not only disrespect the female gender but the wonderfully open nursing profession in general.”“Let’s change the archaic view,” the online community Student Nurse Project posted on Twitter.In response to the backlash, Guinness World Records said on Saturday that it would review the criteria for the record title.“It is quite clear that this record title and associated guidelines is long overdue a review, which we will conduct as a priority in the coming days,” the group said in a statement.The episode comes amid a far broader debate on the disparities faced by female athletes in general, including pay — members of the United States women’s soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit in March over pay equity and working conditions — and over the right to compete as one was born. Caster Semenya, the two-time Olympic champion at 800 meters, lost a challenge on proposed limits for female athletes with  naturally elevated testosterone levels.But the publicity surrounding Ms. Anderson’s case helped her achieve another goal: As of Sunday, she had raised more than 3,000 pounds (about $3,950) for Barts Charity, a nonprofit organization that supports the acute admissions unit where she works in East London — wildly surpassing her initial £500 goal.She said on Sunday that the attention was “a real surprise.”“The vast majority of comments have been really positive, especially from fellow nurses,” Ms. Anderson said, adding that “the chief nursing officers for England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all tweeted pictures of themselves in uniforms!”The London Marathon came under fire last week after it emerged that cleanup crews had appeared to target slow runners with insults.Elizabeth Ayres, who was pacing a group expected to finish in seven and a half hours, told the BBC on Thursday that she heard comments such as “If you weren’t so fat, you could run,” and “This is a race, not a walk.” She said she would “rather the race was canceled than people being spoken to like that.”The director of the London Marathon, Hugh Brasher, apologized to Ms. Ayres and her fellow runners on Thursday.“We are absolutely determined to understand what went on,” he told the BBC. “It will take time to do it, but I can assure you that the investigation will be thorough and as a result of it changes will be made.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/rachel-held-evans.html","Rachel Held Evans, a best-selling author who challenged conservative Christianity and gave voice to a generation of wandering evangelicals wrestling with their faith, died on Saturday at a hospital in Nashville. She was 37.Her husband, Daniel Evans, said in a statement on her website that the cause was extensive brain swelling. During treatment for an infection last month, Ms. Evans began experiencing brain seizures and had been placed in a medically induced coma.“I keep hoping it’s a nightmare from which I’ll awake,” Mr. Evans said in a statement. “Rachel’s presence in this world was a gift to us all, and her work will long survive her.”An Episcopalian, Ms. Evans left the evangelical church in 2014 because, she said, she was done trying to end the church’s culture wars and wanted to focus instead on building a new community among the church’s “refugees”: women who wanted to become ministers, gay Christians and “those who refuse to choose between their intellectual integrity and their faith.”Ms. Evans’s spiritual journey and unique writing voice fostered a community of believers who yearned to seek God and challenge conservative Christian groups that they felt were often exclusionary.Her congregation was online, and her Twitter feed became her church, a gathering place for thousands to question, find safety in their doubts and learn to believe in new ways.Her work became the hub for a diaspora. She brought together once-disparate progressive, post-evangelical groups and hosted conferences to try to include nonwhite and sexual minorities, many of whom felt ostracized by the churches of their youth.She wrote four popular books, which wrestled with evangelicalism and the patriarchy of her conservative Christian upbringing, and documented her transition to a mainline Christian identity, which moved away from biblical literalism toward affirmation of L.G.B.T. people.Her forthcoming conference, called Evolving Faith, to be held in Denver in October, describes itself as “a gathering for wanderers, wonderers and spiritual refugees to help you discover ... You are not alone.”Her close friends Sarah Bessey and Jeffrey Chu, with whom she organized the event, recalled how she had created space, and hope, for evangelicals questioning the institutions of their faith.“She didn’t care at all about fame, except for how it enabled her to proclaim a more just and expansive vision of God’s love, to encourage others, and to amplify voices that are typically marginalized in the Church and in the world,” Mr. Chu wrote in an email.Also in an email, Ms. Bessey said, “One thing about her that I have heard over and over in these days is how relentlessly she championed the voices and experiences of others, especially those whose voices were ignored or marginalized in the Church.”Ms. Evans was known to challenge traditional — and largely male and conservative — authority structures. She would spar with evangelical men on Twitter, debating them on everything from human sexuality to politics to biblical inerrancy.One of those men, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said that he was her theological opposite in almost every way, but that she had always treated him with kindness and humor.“I was on the other side of her Twitter indignation many times, but I respected her because she was never a phony,” Mr. Moore said. “Even in her dissent, she made all of us think, and helped those of us who are theological conservatives to be better because of the way she would challenge us.”Her voice was accessible, raw and piercing, and it interrupted what was more commonly heard in evangelical circles. She drew thousands of followers.“I will sow the seed I have received. Thank you @rachelheldevans,” wrote Alexandria Beightol, a young evangelical, on Twitter. “I’m still a Christian thanks to you. Your legacy includes the thousands of young girls who know God doesn’t hate them.”Rachel Grace Held was born on June 8, 1981, in Alabama to Peter and Robin Held. When she was 14, the family moved from Birmingham to Dayton, Tenn., in the Bible Belt, where her father took an administrative job at Bryan College.In 2003, she earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Bryan College, which was founded in honor of William Jennings Bryan “to teach truth from a Biblical perspective.” The college was chartered following the 1925 Scopes Trial in Dayton, during which Bryan defended a state law barring the teaching of evolution.She married Mr. Evans, her college boyfriend, the same year she graduated. In addition to him, she is survived by their two children, a 3-year-old boy and a girl who is about to turn 1.After moving to Chattanooga, Tenn., where she worked as an intern for The Chattanooga Times Free Press, she returned to Dayton in 2004 and joined The Herald-News. In 2007, she won an award from the Tennessee Press Association for the best personal humor column.Ms. Evans started a blog and in 2010 published her first book, “Evolving in Monkey Town,” the title a reference to the Scopes case. It was republished in 2014 under the title “Faith Unraveled: How a Girl Who Knew All the Answers Learned to Ask Questions.”The book traced her own evolution from religious certainty, like Bryan’s, to a faith that left room for doubt.Among her other books was “A Year of Biblical Womanhood: How a Liberated Woman Found Herself Sitting on Her Roof, Covering Her Head, and Calling Her Husband Master,” which was on The New York Times e-book nonfiction best-seller list.Her most recent book was “Inspired: Slaying Giants, Walking on Water, and Loving the Bible Again.”In 2015, in a column in The Washington Post, which called her “the most polarizing woman in evangelicalism,” she urged: “Want millennials back in the pews? Stop trying to make church ‘cool.’ ”“When I left church at age 29, full of doubt and disillusionment,” she added, “I wasn’t looking for a better-produced Christianity. I was looking for a truer Christianity, a more authentic Christianity.”In 2016, in an essay for Vox, she described herself as a “pro-life Christian” and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.Her last blog post appeared online on Ash Wednesday, March 6, a day of repentance. It signals the start of Lent, which ends with the celebration of resurrection on Easter Sunday.“Whether you are a Christian or an atheist or an agnostic or a so-called ‘none,’ ” Ms. Evans wrote, “you know this truth deep in your bones: ‘Remember that you are dust and to dust you will return.’ ”“Death is a part of life,” she added. “My prayer for you this season is that you make time to celebrate that reality, and to grieve that reality, and that you will know you are not alone.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/new-army-greens-uniform.html","The United States Army wanted a spiffy new service uniform, one that would stand out in a tough recruiting environment and polish the Army’s image after a generation of grinding and divisive wars.So it turned the clock back. Way back.It chose a new uniform that looks almost exactly like the old green gabardine wool field coat and khaki trousers that officers wore in World War II. Probably not by coincidence, that’s what the Army was wearing the last time the nation celebrated total victory in a major war.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]“We went back and asked, when is the most prominent time when the Army’s service to our nation was universally recognized, and the answer came very quickly,” said Daniel A. Dailey, the sergeant major of the Army, the highest-ranking enlisted soldier in the service. “That victory, that impact on the nation, is still felt today by the sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters of the ‘Greatest Generation.’”The troops who beat the Axis powers in the 1940s gave the service uniform, with its slightly rose-hued trousers or skirt and distinctive belted olive coat, an affectionate nickname: “pinks and greens.” This time around, the Army has decided to just call them Army Greens.At a White House event for veterans in April, President Trump praised the style.“Those beautiful new uniforms with the belt — it was a big deal, the belt,” he said. “And if you think those uniforms were inexpensive, they were very expensive. They were very. But they wanted it, and we got it.”Army Greens will be the military equivalent of a business suit, which the Army largely stopped using during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Just as civilians have been dressing more casually in professional and social settings, troops have been wearing camouflage fatigues in situations that used to call for a jacket and tie, like office work or travel between bases. Even in the Pentagon, officers spend a good deal of their time in combat boots.With far fewer troops deployed in combat operations now, though, the Army has signaled that it wants to get back to the old spit and polish. It is hoping that reintroducing an iconic service uniform from the days of the Band of Brothers and Rosie the Riveter will help reframe its public image.The new service uniform is currently in field tests with a few military bands, recruiting battalions and other highly visible troops. With Sergeant Major Dailey overseeing the process, the Army plans to roll out the new uniforms to all soldiers starting in 2020. Soldiers will even be given the option to buy a retro-styled leather bomber jacket to go with the uniform.The Army says that while the new service uniform will cost more than past models to make, it will also last longer, making it cost-neutral overall.In recent years, when the Army has wanted to look sharp, troops have been wearing blue. The current dress uniform (which will be retained for ceremonial use) includes a dark blue coat with light blue trousers or a skirt — colors chosen to evoke the Continentals who fought under George Washington and the Union Army of the Civil War.If that uniform has not caught your eye, it may be because Army Blues can be hard to distinguish, not just from similar Navy and Air Force uniforms, but also from a sea of blue-clad civilians: police officers, firefighters, commercial pilots, even doormen, said Kenneth O. Preston, who served as sergeant major of the Army from 2004 to 2011.“People think you’re a cop,” Mr. Preston said. “They are always stopping you and asking you for directions.”As it happens, that is the same problem that had originally prompted the Army to retire the pinks and greens. After the war ended in 1945, millions of demobilized troops gave away the olive drab uniforms they no longer needed, and heaps more were sold by the Army as surplus. Before long, they were everywhere in civilian life, and had become drab in every sense of the word.Durable and dirt cheap, they became the de facto uniform for field hands, road gangs and trash collectors. An Army major named A.M. Kamp Jr. lamented in the 1954 edition of the Defense Department’s Quartermaster Review that they could be widely seen on prisoners, drunks and “any tramp or derelict who at once adopted the new clothing as his Sunday best.”“The soldier, being constantly confronted with the debauchment of his uniform,” Major Kamp wrote, “soon loses his pride in wearing it.”So that year, the Army began issuing a sleek, modern-looking gray-green polyester-blend service uniform, based on 1950s business suits. Both officers and enlisted soldiers wore that service uniform for the next half-century, until the style was phased out in 2007.“That 1950s was my favorite uniform, very modern, very smart, very American,” said Bruce Bassett-Powell, a historian of military dress and a British Army veteran who now lives in Texas. “But it’s too tied up in associations with Vietnam. And it became the prototype for the uniform of nearly every dictator in South America and Asia. So I suppose it’s best to move on.”Trying to ride the triumphant coattails of past generations through military dress is hardly new. Mr. Bassett-Powell noted that when Napoleon III of France declared war on Prussia in 1870, he dressed his soldiers to look like the army that his much more famous uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, had led decades before to conquer much of Europe. The nephew’s war didn’t turn out so well — he was defeated and captured at Sedan, and his imperial regime collapsed.“Sometimes these throwbacks can boomerang on you,” Mr. Bassett-Powell said.Redesigning a uniform is not as straightforward a task as it may seem, said Jennifer Craik, a professor of fashion at Queensland University of Technology in Australia.Change the uniform too much, and you risk losing the continuity, legitimacy and authority communicated by an Army’s traditional design. “Plastic buttons or a Peter Pan collar simply wouldn’t feel right,” she said.On the other hand, change the uniform too little, and you risk continuing to blend in with the doormen, the pilots and other fashion usurpers.“The right uniform immediately exudes trust and power — it’s a shorthand that says, ‘Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing,’” Ms. Craik said. “Imagine the opposite: If you got on a plane and the pilot turned up in jeans and a T-shirt, you might get right off.”An effective military uniform, she said, has to be distinctive but also immediately recognizable, and the best designs should reflect an institution at its best.“That’s why I think they decided to go back to the old style,” she said. “World War II is seen as a just war, a good war. This uniform says, ‘We are the good guys.’”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/trump-tweet-kentucky-derby.html","President Trump had an opinion about the outcome of the Kentucky Derby and shared it — as he does with so many other opinions — on Twitter on Sunday.“The Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one,” he tweeted. “It was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track, actually, a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby - not even close!”For the first time in the history of the legendary horse race, the horse that crossed the finish line first was disqualified for interference and stripped of its win.The first-place finisher, Maximum Security, was disqualified because he jumped a puddle on the very wet track and slid to the outside, preventing his rival, War of Will, from moving forward and forcing its rider, Tyler Gaffalione, to squeeze his knees just to stay on his horse.At the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, racing stewards watched a video for more than 20 minutes before issuing their ruling: Down came Maximum Security and up went Country House, a 65-1 improbable victor.This was the first time that a foul had invalidated a Kentucky Derby win. Only one other horse has been stripped of its win: In 1968, Dancer’s Image was disqualified after a failed drug test days after the race, leading Forward Pass to be named the winner."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/politics/nancy-pelosi.html","WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not believe President Trump can be removed through impeachment — the only way to do it, she said this week, is to defeat him in 2020 by a margin so “big” he cannot challenge the legitimacy of a Democratic victory.That is something she worries about.“We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that,” Ms. Pelosi said during an interview at the Capitol on Wednesday as she discussed her concern that Mr. Trump would not give up power voluntarily if he lost re-election by a slim margin next year.Sitting in her office with its panoramic view of the National Mall, Ms. Pelosi — the de facto head of the Democratic Party until a presidential nominee is selected in 2020 — offered Democrats her “coldblooded” plan for decisively ridding themselves of Mr. Trump: Do not get dragged into a protracted impeachment bid that will ultimately get crushed in the Republican-controlled Senate, and do not risk alienating the moderate voters who flocked to the party in 2018 by drifting too far to the left.“Own the center left, own the mainstream,” Ms. Pelosi, 79, said.“Our passions were for health care, bigger paychecks, cleaner government — a simple message,” Ms. Pelosi said of the 40-seat Democratic pickup last year that resulted in her second ascent to the speakership. “We did not engage in some of the other exuberances that exist in our party” — a reference to some of the most ambitious plans advocated by the left wing of her party and some 2020 candidates, including “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal, which she has declined to support.Nearly five months into her second speakership, Ms. Pelosi appears to be embracing her role as the only Democrat with the power to oppose Mr. Trump. While she seems comfortable in waging battle with him, her unease about the president’s behavior has only intensified since the Democrats’ triumphal election.Few people outside Ms. Pelosi’s inner circle were aware of how worried she was that Mr. Trump would try to stop the opposition party from taking control of the House unless the Democrats’ victory was emphatic enough to be indisputable.“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” said Ms. Pelosi, recalling her thinking in the run-up to the 2018 elections.“He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can’t seat these people,” she added. “We had to win. Imagine if we hadn’t won — oh, don’t even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach.”In recent weeks Ms. Pelosi has told associates that she does not automatically trust the president to respect the results of any election short of an overwhelming defeat. That view, fed by Mr. Trump’s repeated and unsubstantiated claims of Democratic voter fraud, is one of the reasons she says it is imperative not to play into the president’s hands, especially on impeachment.Over the past two weeks, Mr. Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on Ms. Pelosi, reiterating his intention to block current and former officials like the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II from testifying before Democratic committees. Meantime, Attorney General William P. Barr’s defiant testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee has prompted Ms. Pelosi to declare that he committed “a crime” by contradicting his previous statements about interactions with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The president seems energized by the confrontation, and he views the compliant Republican Senate majority — which is unlikely to convict him if the House brings impeachment proceedings — as a license to goad Ms. Pelosi’s team, according to two people familiar with the president’s thinking.Ms. Pelosi remains committed to avoiding impeachment, but it is clear that she is losing patience. On Wednesday night, after focusing on House business during the day, she watched excerpts from Mr. Barr’s testimony at her residence in Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood.She was incensed that Mr. Barr had seemingly contradicted an earlier claim, made before a House committee in April, that no one on Mr. Mueller’s team had taken issue with the attorney general’s four-page summary of the report’s findings. Mr. Barr’s refusal to testify before the House Judiciary Committee only amplified the speaker’s anger.“When you’re looking at Barr, you just think, ‘How could he sell his soul — alleged soul — to Donald Trump,’” Ms. Pelosi told her whip team early Thursday, according to the detailed notes of a person in the room.Having Mr. Barr as a political target is useful because it allows Democrats to focus their outrage, for a time, on him instead of the president. But increasingly, in public and in private, Ms. Pelosi is suggesting that Mr. Trump’s behavior rises to the level of impeachment, even if she views the process itself as unacceptably dangerous for Democrats.The president has remained curiously polite to the speaker, even as the war between the branches intensifies. His catchall description of Ms. Pelosi is a respectful one — “tough” — and he has told congressional allies that he respects Ms. Pelosi more than her predecessor, Paul D. Ryan, because of her ability to keep backbenchers from hijacking her caucus.“Maybe he knows that I pray for him,” she shrugged. “I pray that his heart will be open for good things, to help people instead of taking babies out of the arms of their mothers, for example.”Ms. Pelosi laced Wednesday’s conversation with scathing descriptions of Mr. Trump’s fitness to serve as president, taking issue with his “attention span” and his “lack of knowledge of the subjects at hand” during their negotiating sessions — and saying his behavior “degrades” the country and “dishonors” the Constitution.Ms. Pelosi laughed when asked how her father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., a Democratic mayor of Baltimore and a former congressman known for his political toughness, would have interacted with Mr. Trump.“Well, it would be like they were speaking foreign languages,” she said. “I don’t think my father could have ever conceived of a president who would ignore his oath of office to the extent this president does.”Ms. Pelosi also shared some thoughts about the expansive and expanding Democratic field of presidential candidates. Joseph R. Biden Jr. “took off because people know him,” she said. “They trust him.”When asked whether Mr. Biden would pay a political price for his grilling of Anita F. Hill during the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, Ms. Pelosi shook her head in the negative and waved a hand dismissively.More than anything, Ms. Pelosi is focused on pursuing center-left policies she thinks will help her party out in 2020 — a focus on pragmatic improvements to health care, ballot access, clean government, immigration and infrastructure, one that emphasizes beating Mr. Trump politically without obsessing over Mr. Trump personally.In her mind, that means grinding away at initiatives that she hopes will help re-elect new members in battleground districts, even if it risks delivering some achievements for Mr. Trump, and angering some critics on the left.Mr. Trump met this week with Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders at the speaker’s request, and agreed to work on a $2 trillion package to repair the nation’s crumbling roads, bridges, sewer systems and waterworks, securing his commitment to expand broadband nationally and undertake an overhaul of the country’s antiquated power grid.“I like the number you’ve been using, Nancy — $2 trillion,” Mr. Trump said, according to an aide who was present at the White House for the meeting. “I’ll lead on this.”The interaction was cordial. At one point, the president plucked a box of white Tic Tacs from his suit jacket and offered it to the speaker, who shook out a couple for herself.Later that night, Mr. Trump cheerfully phoned Ms. Pelosi to reiterate that he really wanted to do a deal — despite the likely opposition of many Senate Republicans and Mick Mulvaney, his interim chief of staff.Ms. Pelosi reiterated her demand that Mr. Trump present her with a detailed plan on how to pay for it, and left feeling optimistic but unsure that the president had the focus to follow through.“Well,” Ms. Pelosi said, “that’s an attention-span subject.”"
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/europe/moscow-plane-aeroflot-fire.html","MOSCOW — Forty-one people were killed on Sunday when a Russian passenger jet made an emergency landing at a Moscow airport, trailing a gigantic plume of flame and black smoke and skidding to a stop on fire. A Russian law enforcement agency, the Investigative Committee, reported that 40 passengers and one crew member lost their lives. There were 78 people on the plane.Videos showed passengers who had escaped the aircraft on exit slides running away from the burning plane on the tarmac as travelers inside the Sheremetyevo airport looked on aghast.[Update: In Russian plane crash, investigators look at pilot error, equipment failure and weather.] “We were witnesses to this horror,” one woman, Alena Osokina, told Russia’s Dozhd television station.Aeroflot Flight 1492 took off from Moscow  bound for Murmansk, a port city in northern Russia. But immediately after takeoff, the pilots radioed a distress call, Interfax reported, and the plane, a Sukhoi SSJ-100, circled back for an emergency landing. The cockpit crew stopped responding by radio after reporting the emergency, Interfax reported.Flightradar24, which tracks transponders on airplanes, showed the jet looping once in the air before landing. Russian news agencies said the pilots landed on their second attempt.  The plane caught fire after landing. Video showed that the aircraft was not burning on its final approach. It bounced on touchdown and caught fire as it struck the runway a second time. Then the plane skidded along the runway with its nose angled upward, the engines scraping the ground and flames streaking out behind.Later, flames could be seen spreading on the pavement, suggesting that fuel was leaking and burning. Fire crews sprayed the plane from trucks.Dozens of people, if not hundreds, witnessed the crash from inside the terminal, where waiting areas and restaurants offer expansive views of the runways. “Right in front of our eyes, we saw an airplane on fire streaking down the runway,” Ms. Osokina, who was in an airport restaurant, told Dozhd television.“It was in the grips of flames,” she said. “Flames were devouring it every second,” she said. Kommersant FM, a radio station, posted a cellphone video taken by a passenger on the airplane as it landed that showed a scene of panic and terror. It showed a burning engine and flames at times obscuring the entire window. As smoke starts to fill the cabin, one woman screams. Another yells, “Help! Help!”Others took videos from inside the terminal and posted them on social media. “Amazing,” a witness can be heard saying on one of them. Safety concerns with the Sukhoi Superjet, Russia’s first newly designed post-Soviet passenger plane, emerged soon after its introduction in 2008. Dozens of employees at the Siberia plant were found to have faked their university engineering diplomas.In 2012, a Superjet crashed into a mountain in Indonesia during a sales demonstration flight carrying 37 aviation executives and journalists, and eight crew members, killing all aboard. An investigation cited pilot error. In 2016, Russian safety regulators grounded the fleet after discovering metal fatigue, usually a problem associated with older airplanes, in the tail section of a Sukhoi jet. Russian aviation officials have said the plane had no more than the typical teething problems of a new aircraft.Aeroflot, the Russian national airline,  has worked hard to overcome its once-poor safety image. Safety woes shadowed the company in the immediate post-Soviet period. In 1994, for example, a pilot let his 16-year-old son fly an Airbus that promptly crashed, killing all 75 aboard.Recently, however, the airline has operated one of Europe’s newest fleets of passenger jets."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/business/boeing-737-max-warning-light.html","When Boeing began delivering its 737 Max to customers in 2017, the company believed that a key cockpit warning light was a standard feature in all of the new jets.But months after the planes were flying, company engineers realized that the warning light worked only on planes whose customers had bought a different, optional indicator.In essence, that meant a safety feature that Boeing thought was standard was actually a premium add-on.Boeing detailed its initial confusion about the warning light in a statement released on Sunday, adding new details to what was already known about the flawed design and introduction of the 737 Max, its best-selling jetliner.The initial lack of knowledge about the feature’s functionality, along with the delayed disclosure, add to the concern about Boeing’s management of the Max’s design. The revelations add to Boeing’s mounting problems, which include frayed relations with airlines and customers, multiple federal investigations, growing financial costs and the remaining work to get the Max flying again.The warning light notifies pilots of a disagreement in the sensors that measure which direction the plane is pointed, a potential sign of a malfunction. This light could have provided critical information to the pilots on two flights that crashed shortly after takeoff in recent months.In both doomed flights — Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — preliminary investigations suggest that there were problems with these so-called angle of attack sensors early in the flights, activating new anti-stall software that sent the planes into unrecoverable nose-dives.But the disagree alert worked only on planes with an optional indicator that displays the readings from the angle of attack sensors, Boeing said on Sunday.Because only 20 percent of customers had purchased the optional indicator, the warning light was not working on most of Boeing’s new jets. Neither Lion Air nor Ethiopian had the indicator.After discovering the lapse in 2017, Boeing performed an internal review and determined that the lack of a working warning light “did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation,” it said in its statement.As a result, Boeing said it did not inform airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration about the mistake for a year.Only after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October did Boeing discuss the matter with the F.A.A. The company then conducted another review and again found the missing alert did not pose a safety threat, and told the F.A.A. as much.Boeing and the F.A.A. put out public updates late last year that described the warning light as available only if the optional indicator had been purchased as well.But neither statement made it clear that Boeing had intended for the disagree alert to be standard in all planes.The F.A.A. said on Sunday that Boeing briefed it on the confusion in November, and that it deemed the issue to be “low risk.”“However, Boeing’s timely or earlier communication with the operators would have helped to reduce or eliminate possible confusion,” the F.A.A. said.The anti-stall system, created to compensate for the Max’s large new engines, will push down the nose of the plane if the angle of attack sensors indicate the plane is dangerously close to stalling.But the system relied on only one of the two angle of attack sensors, introducing a potential single point of failure into a critical flight system. And the anti-stall system was also changed late in the design process to make it much more powerful.Airlines and pilots were not informed about the system until the Lion Air crash.When Boeing explained to pilots in one meeting how systems on the Max worked, the company said that the disagree alert would function on the ground. In the late November meeting, Boeing told pilots for American Airlines (which had bought the add-on) that their disagree alert would have notified them of problems before takeoff.“We were told that if the A.O.A. vane, like on Lion Air, was in a massive difference, we would receive an alert on the ground and therefore not even take off,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union representing American Airlines pilots. “That gave us additional confidence in continuing to fly that aircraft.”But in the last several weeks, Boeing has been saying something different. Mr. Tajer said the company recently told American pilots that the system would not alert pilots about any sensor disagreement until the aircraft is 400 feet above the ground.A Boeing spokesman confirmed this, stressing that the disagree alert does not work on the ground, and thus could not have alerted the Lion Air pilots to a faulty sensor before takeoff.Mr. Tajer said Boeing seemed to have “provided information that was not accurate” and said the pilots have asked for clarification from the company.Mr. Tajer, who is also a 737 pilot, said he was concerned that Boeing did not seem to fully grasp how every aspect of the Max worked.“You better start knowing things about the airplane you’re building and selling because my life and the passengers that I carry safely across the globe depends on it,” Mr. Tajer said.The Lion Air crash also spurred Boeing to notify Southwest pilots about the disagree light. “We thought it worked,” said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Pilots’ Association. “If they knew it in 2017, why did we get to nearly the end of 2018 until the manual was changed?”In the months after the Lion Air crash, Boeing quietly worked to appease some customers, according to a person briefed on the matter. In several instances, it activated the angle of attack indicator for free, which then turned on the disagree alert.The 737 Max has been grounded for more than a month, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing is working on a software fix that it plans to submit to the F.A.A. soon, in hopes that the Max can return to flight later this summer. The update will make the anti-stall system less powerful and reliant on both sensors.Boeing is also developing a separate software update that will unlink the disagree alert from the angle of attack indicators, which will also be installed before the Max can fly again."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/middleeast/gaza-rockets-israel-palestinians.html","JERUSALEM — Fighting between Israel and Gaza escalated rapidly on Sunday in the worst combat since the last full-blown war in 2014, with Palestinian rocket and missile attacks killing four Israeli civilians and Israeli forces taking aim at individual Gaza militants.Gaza officials said the two-day death toll for Palestinians had reached 22. At least nine militants and as many civilians were killed on Sunday alone. The civilians included a pregnant woman, a 12-year-old boy and 4-month-old girl, health officials said.The Palestinians said early on Monday that they had reached a cease-fire with Israel. That news appeared to be confirmed indirectly when the Israeli military on Monday morning lifted restrictions on citizens living near the border with Gaza, though schools in affected areas remained closed for the day.The outbreak of violence appears to have begun on Friday, when a sniper wounded two Israeli soldiers, a violent but localized expression of Palestinian impatience with Israel’s failure to alleviate dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza.By Sunday, it had mushroomed into a display of firepower by both sides. The Israel army said Gazans had launched 600 projectiles in two days, with the territory’s secretive armed factions letting loose hundreds of rockets that had long been hidden away in arsenals.Howling air-raid sirens and buzzing smartphone alerts kept tens of thousands of Israeli civilians hunkered down in shelters. The country’s Iron Dome antimissile batteries shot many — but not nearly all — of the incoming projectiles out of the sky as the Israeli military rumbled into action with jets, drones, tanks, artillery and attack helicopters.Palestinians seized every opportunity to wreak havoc, killing an Israeli civilian with an anti-tank missile when he made the mistake of driving his truck within range of Gaza. They fired another, this time unsuccessfully, at an Israeli armored personnel carrier that was only partially obscured by defensive berms.Ratcheting up its response, Israel blew up a car carrying a Gaza man it said was a terrorist, and published video of that airstrike as a warning to others. It leveled the homes of several militant commanders, saying they were used to store weapons or as operational headquarters, and fired on a number of Palestinians it said were engaged in launching rockets.It also attacked a building it said had been used as a base for cyberattacks against Israel, partially destroying it.The two antagonists have warred on and off since the militant Islamic group Hamas took power in Gaza in 2007 and Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade of the territory and its roughly two million residents.But as much as they loathe one another, they are also codependent: Hamas uses its defiance of Israel to portray itself as the true voice of Palestinian resistance, and Israel’s right-wing government exploits Gaza’s unruliness to argue that it lacks a partner for peace talks.The fury of the weekend’s fighting reflected pent-up Palestinian frustrations over Israel’s slow pace in easing restrictions that have sent the densely populated and impoverished territory into economic free fall, said Tareq Baconi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.In November, Israel agreed to loosen the restrictions in an arrangement brokered by Egypt with Hamas.“Hamas agreed to restrain the protests in return for concessions,” Mr. Baconi said, referring to the frequently violent border demonstrations that began in Gaza in March 2018. “Those haven’t materialized.”Israel’s decision this weekend to resort to targeted killing and to signal its readiness for a ground war was a reminder of the country’s low tolerance for the loss of civilian life.But as has happened in so many other rounds of fighting in recent months, the violence quickly became so intense that each side seemed to pause long enough to listen for the words “cease-fire.”Late Sunday, it was Ismail Haniya, the political director of Hamas, who uttered them.Mr. Haniya said that “returning to the state of calm is possible and depends on the occupation’s commitment to a complete cease-fire” and on the “immediate start of implementing the understandings” reached with Egypt’s help.But he also threatened to escalate if Israel did not comply, and more Israeli alerts of incoming rockets soon followed.The Israeli civilians killed were the first to die in clashes with Gaza since the brief but devastating 2014 conflict. A Palestinian man living in Israel was killed in a rocket attack on Ashkelon in November.One Israeli man was killed well before dawn Sunday when he left a safe room for a cigarette break and a rocket exploded in the yard of the house. In the afternoon, a strike on an Israeli cement factory in the southern city of Ashkelon killed a Bedouin worker. The man killed after stopping his truck was near Or Haner, a tiny kibbutz two miles from the Gaza border.And in the southern city of Ashdod, a rabbi was killed when he left his car and tried to run for cover.Israel responded by following through on a longstanding threat — one heard more frequently in recent days from hawkish politicians — to start killing individual fighters in targeted attacks.An airstrike that destroyed a car in Gaza City killed a man who the Israeli military said had been responsible for large transfers of cash from Iran to Hamas and to a rival faction in Gaza, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel said the man, Ahmad Hamed Al-Khudary, 34, had owned a money exchange company that it designated a terrorist organization last June.Asked why Israel had resumed the long-dormant tactic of targeted killings, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said, “It’s important for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to understand the severity of the situation.”All told, of the nine militants killed Sunday, only one was a Hamas member, Gaza officials said. Eight belonged to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including two killed in an airstrike on the Al Buraij refugee camp.The attacks from Gaza mostly hit targets in southern Israel with no military value, including a building housing a kindergarten in the town of Sderot and the oncology department at Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon. An army post in the community of Kissufim was hit by a mortar that struck its synagogue, lightly wounding two soldiers.With rockets and mortars setting off sirens across southern Israel every few minutes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered what he called “massive strikes,” and the military deployed an armored brigade and the Golani infantry brigade to the Gaza frontier to be available for a possible ground incursion. Another infantry brigade was put on standby.Israel pushed back aggressively on Sunday against Palestinian accusations that it had killed a pregnant Gaza woman and a young family member the day before. Army spokesmen insisted that the two had been killed by a misfired Palestinian rocket, not by Israeli munitions. Gaza officials continued to accuse Israel of what they called a war crime.President Trump on Sunday came down decisively on Israel’s side, condemning the rocket attacks from Gaza. “To the Gazan people — these terrorist acts against Israel will bring you nothing but more misery,” he said on Twitter.The latest round of violence began much like several others since last summer.Israel and Gaza have been locked in a cycle of clashes quickly followed by de-escalations, with Egyptian-brokered talks repeatedly achieving a temporary cooling off along the border.In November, there appeared to be a breakthrough. Israel promised to ameliorate conditions in Gaza by allowing in cash supplied by Qatar, as well as fuel and humanitarian aid; expanding the zone in the Mediterranean in which it would allow Gaza fishermen to operate; and easing the movement of people in and out of the impoverished seaside territory.Hamas agreed in return to restrain protests along its frontier with Israel that have often devolved into violence. But a truce has never taken hold, and indeed the cease-fires have only lasted a number of weeks.Some resumptions of violence have been unforeseeable. In October, a freak of nature — a lightning strike — was said to have caused a rocket to be launched at Israel. In November, an Israeli undercover team was discovered inside Gaza, setting off a firefight as it made its escape and then two days of rocket attacks and airstrikes.A rocket attack in mid-March was said to be a result of “human error” rather than a Hamas decision.But Israel has also accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of using violence for political advantage. In late March, two weeks before Israel’s parliamentary elections, a rocket hit a house northeast of Tel Aviv and caused Mr. Netanyahu to cut short a trip to Washington.Now, with Israel’s Memorial Day and Independence Day celebrations coming this week, and a stream of international singers arriving to compete in the Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv later this month, the Gaza militant groups may have gambled that Mr. Netanyahu would pay an even higher price for quiet in the short term.“Both of them believe that only pressure and force will force Israel to ease the restrictions of the blockade,” said Mr. Baconi, the analyst. “And Israel has done nothing but reinforce that lesson.”Sunday night, on the eve of Ramadan, the monthlong Muslim holiday of daylong fasting and nighttime feasts, Israel tightened its chokehold on Gaza. It said it would cut off the supply of all fuel to the territory through Israel.Omar Shaban, an economist who runs Pal-Think for Strategic Studies, a Gaza think tank, said that some of the recriminations between Israel and Gaza officials over easing the deprivations in Gaza had been missing the point.“There’s no shortage of food in Gaza, but people don’t have purchasing power because there are no jobs,” he said. “There are some demands by the political factions that cannot be implemented: If you open the crossings while people don’t have cash for the private sector to operate, it’s pointless. Gaza needs a package of assistance.”On the Israeli side, even some critics of Mr. Netanyahu said that the cycle of violence with Gaza was only strengthening his hand politically.“His view — which, incidentally, is logical — is that the division between Gaza and the West Bank, which stems from the chronic conflict between Hamas and Fatah, weakens the national Palestinian movement and is worth the headache inherent in dealing with two semi-functional political entities,” Shimrit Meir, an Israeli analyst of Palestinian politics, wrote in the daily Yediot Ahronot.The two Palestinian territories, Gaza and the West Bank, are governed by the rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah.On Sunday, as the family of one of the Israelis killed in the attack, Moshe Agadi, 58, prepared to bury him, it asked the public to avoid his funeral for fear of another strike from Gaza. Hundreds of Israelis came anyway, and home front soldiers wearing orange berets passed out instructions on what to do if the cemetery came under attack.“We came to honor him, and to show that we’re not afraid of them,” said Tzipi Ben-David, 56, as distant blasts could be heard in the direction of Gaza. “Look how many came, even with this situation.”At the home were Mr. Agadi had been staying, a golden-painted suburban dream house, large shrapnel divots in the exterior wall, a felled tree and grapefruits strewn on the ground all testified to what had killed him."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/world/middleeast/us-iran-military-threat-.html","WASHINGTON — The White House announced on Sunday that the United States was sending an aircraft carrier strike group and Air Force bombers to the Middle East because of “troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” related to Iran.The deployment was intended “to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force,” said John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, in a statement released Sunday night.[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]The announcement did not give any further information on the reasons for the commitment of military forces. An American military official said on Sunday night that whatever threat Mr. Bolton cited had most likely emerged in the previous 24 to 48 hours because as of late Friday, military analysts were not tracking any new, imminent or clearly defined Iranian or Iranian-backed threats against Americans in Iraq or the region.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, when asked by reporters about Mr. Bolton’s statement on a flight to Finland, said, “It’s something we’ve been working on for a little while.”“It is absolutely the case that we’ve seen escalatory action from the Iranians, and it is equally the case that we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests,” he said. “The fact that those actions take place, if they do, by some third-party proxy, whether that’s a Shia militia group or the Houthis or Hezbollah, we will hold the Iranians — Iranian leadership — directly accountable for that.”There have been escalating rounds of fatal violence between Hamas, the armed Palestinian group in Gaza, and the Israeli military in recent days, but an American official said that was not related to the military ramp-up in the Persian Gulf. Although Iran has provided financing to Hamas, there is no sign that it was involved in the recent rocket attacks against Israel.“The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps or regular Iranian forces,” Mr. Bolton said in the statement.The carrier group heading to the Persian Gulf is that of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, which has been in the Mediterranean Sea. There is no carrier strike group currently in the Persian Gulf, but such groups often transit through those waters since the Suez Canal is in the region.At the end of April, the Abraham Lincoln and its fleet of accompanying ships trained alongside other American vessels and military units from the United Kingdom, Spain and France.A Pentagon spokesman confirmed the military moves as outlined in Mr. Bolton’s statement but declined to provide more details.“We will not distinguish between attacks from Shia militias in #Iraq and the #IRGC that controls them,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Monday morning on Twitter. “Any attack by these groups against U.S. forces will be considered an attack by #Iran & responded to accordingly.”The Trump administration has taken a hard-line policy against Iran and has said it aims to force Iran to lessen or end its support for Shiite militias and other groups across the Middle East.One year ago, President Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal that world powers had reached with Iran in 2015, and he has since imposed harsh sanctions intended to force political change in Tehran. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been the leaders in formulating the new hard-line policies, often in direct opposition to recommendations from the Defense Department and C.I.A.Last month, the Trump administration designated the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization. The move imposes economic penalties and travel restrictions on members of the group, a unit of Iran’s military, and anyone else who deals with it. The terrorist designation was the first time the United States had made that move against a part of another nation’s government.Although Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo pushed hard for the designation, defense and intelligence officials opposed it out of concern Iran would take reciprocal action against American military personnel and intelligence operatives or launch attacks.On Tuesday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran signed a bill into law that declared all American troops in the Middle East terrorists and labeled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism.On Thursday, the Trump administration allowed oil purchase waivers for Iran to expire, in an effort to cut off all revenue that Iran gets from export of its oil. Last November, when it imposed major sanctions on Iran, the United States gave six-month waivers to eight nations to continue buying oil. American officials had signaled to the countries this spring they would continue the waivers, but made a surprise announcement last month that the waivers would end. China and Turkey, two of the customers, have said they oppose the American sanctions.On Friday, American officials announced they would extend most waivers that allow some countries to work with Iran on a limited civil nuclear program, but said the waivers would be good only for 90 days.Last month, Republican and Democratic senators asked Mr. Pompeo whether the administration would explicitly seek congressional approval before trying to enter a war with Iran. Mr. Pompeo demurred, saying lawyers should answer that question.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, insisted that the United States could not attack Iran as part of a war authorization allowing the use of military force against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups deemed responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Mr. Pompeo has said Iran bears more responsibility for ongoing violence in the Middle East than any other actor, even though the American military has been focused on fighting the Islamic State, a Sunni extremist group to which the Shiite government of Iran is opposed. The Iranian military has helped the Shiite-led government of Iraq combat the Islamic State, which had seized territory in northern Iraq and eastern Syria.The Trump administration also has criticized Iran for its support of Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and military group, and of the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group in Yemen.Iranian forces and their proxy fighters have generally refrained from attacking American troops in recent years.At the height of the Iraq war in the mid-2000s, Iranian military officials helped train Iraqi Shiite militias to fight American troops and aided in the building of powerful explosive devices used against American armored vehicles. The Pentagon has said at least 603 American personnel were killed in Iraq by Iran-backed fighters — 17 percent of all Americans killed in hostile action there.Last month, a bomber task force composed of six Air Force B-52 bombers and 450 troops from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana returned to the United States after training in Britain. It is unclear if the same unit is redeploying to the Middle East."
